        "What is the? ( SEO Description 100-200 words) ": "Western Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) is a hardy perennial wildflower prized for its feathery foliage and clusters of creamy white blooms. A versatile native plant, yarrow thrives in poor, dry soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It blooms from late spring through fall, attracting butterflies, bees, and other beneficial pollinators to the garden. Gardeners love yarrow for its low maintenance and resilience—deer and rabbits tend to avoid it—and it can even handle coastal conditions and moderate shade. Use Western Yarrow in waterwise landscapes, wildflower meadows, or as a fragrant, long-blooming cut flower. This tough plant will spread over time via rhizomes, creating a natural carpet of greenery topped with flat-topped flower clusters that add classic charm.",

Native to the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts, it grows 2–4 feet tall and wide. In spring and after rains, plants burst into golden blooms that draw bees and butterflies. Incredibly drought-tolerant, Brittlebush thrives in full sun with minimal water and prefers sandy or rocky, fast-draining soils—even bare gravel slopes. It may drop leaves during the driest times to conserve moisture. Excellent for desert landscapes, xeriscaping, and erosion control on arid slopes; low-maintenance and deer-resistant.",
